GOTEO API
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GoteoFoundation/goteo-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GoteoFoundation/goteo-api) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/GoteoFoundation/goteo-api/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/GoteoFoundation/goteo-api) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/GoteoFoundation/goteo-api/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/GoteoFoundation/goteo-api/coverage)

This is the code for the [goteo api](http://api.goteo.org/).

Please refer to the INSTALL.md file for info about installing this API.

Full documentation to use the official api can be found here: https://developers.goteo.org/doc/

Easy install using Vagrant:
----------

The included `Vagrantfile` is ready to provision a ready-to-go system with a test database and all the required dependencies installed:

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
./run
```

Install/update dependencies:
----------

```bash
./deployer
```

Run a test server on localhost:
----------

```bash
./run
```

Flask command line order:
----------

Cache clearing:

```bash
./console clearcache
```

Cache renewing:

```bash
./console renewcache
```

Crontab install for automatic cache renew:

```bash
./console crontab -i
```

Remove crontab install:
```bash
./console crontab -r
```

Running tests:
----------

**NOTE:** Testing with the argument `--reset-database` will remove all tables in the test database!

Configure a proper `config_test.py` before testing

First time you may want to reset the test database:

```bash
./run-tests --reset-database
```

All tests at once (verbose):

```bash
./run-tests -v
```

Specific tests: (verbose, with echoes):

```bash
./run-tests goteoapi -v -s goteoapi/tests/testprojects.py
```

Running code coverage tests:

```bash
./run-tests --cover-html --with-coverage
```

Running code coverage tests with all packages:

```bash
./run-tests --cover-html --with-coverage --cover-package=goteoapi_reports --cover-package=goteoapi_digests
```

Tests uses [nosetests](https://nose.readthedocs.org). Same nosetests command arguments applies to `run-tests` script

Extending the API
----------

To run the API with extra packages you must configure the variable `MODULES` int the file `config.py` (extra packages such as: goteoapi_reports, goteoapi_digests)

```python
...

MODULES = {
    # reports endpoints
    'goteoapi_reports.controllers',
    # digests endpoints
    'goteoapi_digests.controllers'
}

...
```

Examples
----------

Obtain a list of active projects:

```bash
curl -i --user "goteo:goteo" http://0.0.0.0:5000/projects
```

Getting details for a custom project:

```bash
curl -i --user "goteo:goteo" http://0.0.0.0:5000/projects/project-id
```

Filtering some data, in this case, all projectes published starting in october 2015:

```bash
curl --user "goteo:goteo" -i -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"from_date":"2015-10-01"}' http://localhost:5000/projects/
```

Obtaining an error message:

```bash
curl -i --user "goteo:goteo" -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://0.0.0.0:5000/projects/
```

Response:

```json
